<div id="wrapper">The Megalodon is outstanding and breathe taking creature to  
 just even think about more than half of a football field three times the size  
of  a Great White shark which is our largest living shark in today's age  
remarkable  to think about isn't it but there is a great uprising of debate  
whether it's a  myth or real and that's what we're going to research megalodon  
has been debated  for nearly a century, and is still under dispute. A major

<h3>According to Renaissance accounts, gigantic, triangular fossil teeth often  
 found embedded in rocky formations were once believed to be the petrified  
 tongues, or glossopetrae, of dragons and snakes. This interpretation was  
 corrected in 1667 by Danish naturalist Nicolaus Steno, who recognized them as  
 shark teeth, and famously produced a depiction of a shark's head bearing such  
 teeth. He described his findings in the book The Head of a Shark Dissected,  
 which also contained an illustration of a. Swiss naturalist Louis Agassiz gave  
 the shark its initial scientific name, Carcharodon megalodon, in 1835, in his  
 research work Recherché sur les poisons fossils[ Research on fossil fish, which 
  he completed in 1843. megalodon teeth are morphologically similar to the teeth 
  of the great white shark, and on the basis of this observation, Agassiz  
 assigned. megalodon to the genus Carcharodon. While the scientific name is.  
 megalodon, it is often informally dubbed the "megatooth shark", "giant white  
 shark" or "monster shark". megalodon is represented in the fossil record  
 primarily by teeth and vertebral centra.</h3>
<p>As with all sharks, Megalodon's skeleton was formed of cartilage rather than  
 bone; this means that most fossil specimens are poorly preserved. While the  
 earliest. megalodon remains were reported from late Oligocene strata, around 28 
  million years old, a more reliable date for the origin of the species is the  
 early Miocene, about 23 million years ago. Although fossils are mostly absent  
in  strata extending beyond the Tertiary boundary, they have been reported from  
subsequent Pleistocene strata. I Some fossil vertebrae have been found. The  
most  notable example is a partially preserved vertebral column of a single  
specimen,  excavated in the Antwerp basin, Belgium by M. Leriche in 1926. It  
comprises 150  vertebral centra, with the centra ranging from 55 millimetres  
(2.2 in) to 155  millimetres (6.1 in) in diameter. However, scientists have  
claimed that  considerably larger vertebral centra can be expected. A partially  
preserved  vertebral column of another megalodon specimen was excavatedfrom.</p></section><br><br>

 ashore today. The proof is in the pudding. There will always be critics, but  
you  can't deny facts and evidence.</h2></div>
